# lua-pcg on DOSBox

Below, these tutorials guiding you to build, run and test `lua-pcg` on DOSBox were born from wishes to test ANSI C compliance for the library. Moreover, on DOSBox, the library can be tested on old 16-bit operating systems with limited access to resources. If you want to experiment, at the moment, it is possible to follow tutorials on Linux and Windows:

* [Build, run and test lua-pcg on DOS using a Linux host](./DOSBox-Linux.md)
* [Build, run and test lua-pcg on DOS using a Windows host](./DOSBox-Windows.md)
