# lua-pcg on DOSBox

Below, these tutorials guiding you to build, run and test `lua-pcg` on DOSBox were born from wishes to test C89 compliance for the library. Moreover, on DOSBox, the library can be tested on old 16-bit operating systems with limited access to resources. If you want to experiment, at the moment, it is possible to follow tutorials on Linux and Windows:

* [Build, run and test lua-pcg on DOS using a Linux host](./DOSBox-Linux.md)
* [Build, run and test lua-pcg on DOS using a Windows host](./DOSBox-Windows.md)

For these tutorials above, the excellent content published by `xdknight` [https://www.whoop.ee/post/compiling-lua-for-ms-dos-or-freedos.html](https://www.whoop.ee/post/compiling-lua-for-ms-dos-or-freedos.html) to build Lua 5.4.7 gave me the right direction that I needed to patch Lua sources in some sensible spots.
